# ReverseNodeSum
Coding Challenge 1
This is the 2 parts of the first weekly coding challenge in my company's onboarding curricula. The instructions are below.

1) Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a
function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

EXAMPLE
Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.

FOLLOW UP
Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912.

2) Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.
